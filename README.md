# Astro260Homework4
Running Homework4.py with python Homework4.py will run all calculations and show the contour plot of electric potential first, then show a streamplot of the electric field.
I used a streamplot because I could not get the quiver plot to work correctly.

Homework4Part2.py will show the plot for the second part of the homework. Simply run it with python Homework4Part2.py
